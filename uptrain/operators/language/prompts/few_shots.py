[Question]: How does caffeine affect the body?
[Context]: Caffeine is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system, making you feel more awake and alert. It is found in coffee, tea, chocolate, many soft drinks, and some medications. Consuming caffeine can lead to increased alertness, but excessive intake may cause nervousness, insomnia, stomach upset, increased heart rate, and even muscle tremors.
