We will be using around 30 randomly picked examples from the Financial QA dataset and evaluate the response on different criteria to determine which of the two models performs better. This notebook benchmarks 2 variations of the same model called Roberta, one being noncompressed other being the compressed version using knowledge distillation. We also use UpTrain's metrics to further evaluate the outputs from both models\n",

This would look suspicious on paper, even it was obvious to you.  This is less to do with your financial institution, and more to do with increased fraud prevention. Call your bank.

It's not just big transactions anymore, it's scattered little ones, etc. Our credit union had to buy software that runs through transactions sniffing for suspicious patterns.  More regulations and more costs that ultimately get passed on to customers in one way or another. Some of your transactions probably tripped a wire where there was none before.\\nContrary to what many people think, credit card companies pass nearly all fraud costs via purchased goods onto the merchant who sells them. As a result, they stand a very high chance of getting the money from a fraudulent purchase of a specific purchased item back, as they just chargeback the merchant who has to stomach the cost. This is not the case for cash transactions obviously, where as soon as the money leaves the ATM fraudulently it is as good as gone.
