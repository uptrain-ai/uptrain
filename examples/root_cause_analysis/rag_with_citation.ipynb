    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is the process of utilising external knowledge in your LLM-based application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:** Imagine an LLM-powered chatbot that answers users' queries by leveraging a set of FAQs and knowledge documents outlining the company's customer support policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM consumes the user query along with relevant information (context retrieved by vector database) and produces a response to solve the user query along with citations of the different sources which were actually utilized by the LLM for generating the response."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## How will this tutorial help?\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have built an RAG application. The next step is to test it, find failure cases, and fix them. However, debugging these failure cases is not straightforward. There could be multiple reasons for failureâ€”maybe the retrieval failed, the LLM is not able to utilize the retrieved context to generate a good response, it hallucinated, or even the user query itself was not clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aide with this, UpTrain provides root cause analysis tools to figure out what exactly is going wrong with each failure case. RAG_WITH_CITATION is one such RCA template that helps in debugging RAG applications that output cited responses.\n",
    "\n",

    "|**Poor Context Utilization**|The LLM is not able to utilize all the information present in the context|The user asks \"Do you offer same-day delivery?\" The LLM replies, \"I am not sure\", even if the retrieved context has information that same-day delivery is not possible|\n",
    "|**Poor Retrieval**|The context given to an LLM does not have information relevant to the question|The user asks \"Do you deliver to Bangalore?\" but the context does not have any information to deliveries in Bangalore|\n",
    "|**Hallucinations**|The generated response is not supported by information present in the context|The LLM generates a response \"We deliver to Bangalore\" when the information present in the context is: \"We are going to start delivers in Bangalore soon\" |\n",
    "|**Incorrect Citation**|While the response is correct, it's not correctly cited, eroding users' trust|The LLM cites \"We deliver to Delhi\" from the context for a response saying \"We deliver to Bangalore\"|\n",
    "|**Incomplete Question**|The user's question itself is unclear or does not make sense|The user asks something like: \"delivery?\", \"What location?\", \"ajdjwsp\"|"
