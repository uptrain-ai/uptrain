    "**What is Guideline Adherence?**: Guideline adherence refers to the extent to which the LLM follows a given guideline, rule, or protocol. Given the complexity of LLMs, it is crucial to define certain guidelines, be it in terms of the structure of the output or the constraints on the content of the output or protocols on the decision-making capabilities of the LLM (agents). \n",
