Title: Accelerated Automated Finetuning of LLMs for Domain sSpecific Tasks

Introduction:
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other domains. One key factor that has contributed to the success of deep learning is the use of pretrained networks, which are neural networks that have been trained on large datasets and can be used as a starting point for building custom models. Among various techniques, finetuning is a popular approach that allows us to adapt a pretrained model to a specific task or dataset. In this blog, we will explore the concept of finetuning, its benefits, and best practices for finetuning a deep learning model.

What is Finetuning?
Finetuning, also known as transfer learning, is a process of taking a pretrained neural network and adapting it to a new task or dataset. The idea is to leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset during the pretraining phase and apply it to a smaller dataset or a different task. This can save a significant amount of time and computational resources compared to training a deep neural network from scratch on a new task or dataset.

Benefits of Finetuning:

- Faster Training: One of the main advantages of finetuning is that it can significantly speed up the training process. Since the pretrained network has already learned generic features from a large dataset, it can serve as a good initialization for the new task. This allows the network to converge faster during training, reducing the number of iterations needed to achieve good performance.

- Better Performance: Finetuning a pretrained model can also lead to better performance compared to training from scratch, especially when the new dataset is small. Pretrained models have already learned useful representations from a large dataset, which can be transferred to the new task. This can help overcome the problem of limited data, which is often a challenge in deep learning.

- Robustness: Another benefit of finetuning is that it can improve the robustness of the model. Pretrained models have already been exposed to a diverse range of data during the pretraining phase, which can help the model generalize better to different variations in the new dataset. This can result in a more robust and adaptable model.

Why Finetuning Matters for LLMs?

- Task-Specific Adaptation: LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data from the internet, which makes them proficient at capturing general language patterns and representations. However, for specific tasks or domains, fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to the nuances and specificities of the target task or domain. Finetuning LLMs with task-specific data can greatly improve their performance and make them more effective for the specific task at hand.

- Data Efficiency: LLMs are typically pretrained on large amounts of data, which enables them to learn general language patterns. However, for many NLP tasks, labeled data for finetuning may be scarce or expensive to obtain. Finetuning allows us to leverage the pretrained knowledge of LLMs and adapt them to smaller labeled datasets, making them more data-efficient. This is particularly useful when dealing with tasks where labeled data is limited, such as domain-specific or specialized tasks.

- Domain Adaptation: LLMs trained on generic data may not perform optimally when applied to domain-specific tasks. For example, a language model pretrained on news articles may not be as effective for medical text analysis. Finetuning allows the model to adapt to the specific domain by using domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This helps in capturing domain-specific jargon, terminologies, and nuances, resulting in improved performance for domain-specific NLP tasks.

- Customization and Control: Finetuning LLMs provides an opportunity for customization and control over the language model's behavior. By finetuning, you can guide the model to generate text that aligns with specific requirements, such as maintaining a certain style, tone, or voice. This allows for more tailored outputs that meet the specific needs of the task or domain, making finetuning a powerful tool for content creation, branding, and other language-related applications.

Finetuning an LLM involves several steps, including task definition, data preparation, pretrained model selection, model architecture modification, training setup, fine-tuning, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, and model monitoring and maintenance. Properly following these steps can help you effectively adapt a pre-trained LLM to a specific task and achieve high performance on your target task.In addition to this, accurate selection of hyperparameters can help in greatly accelerating the finetuning process. 

Uptrain's automated finetuning framework builds on the theory that different layers in the neural network have different loss profiles, and hence, having different learning rates for different layers based on there loss profile can lead to a finetuned model at a much faster pace. We,at uptrain also take motivation from HTSR theory (mentioned in https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-410.html) to calculate a set of training parameters that helps the model converge at a much faster rate.

In the following example, we take a sample dataset of spam detection and finetune BERT to classify a sample email as spam or not. 
In order to finetune a pretrained BERT, you need to provide the dataloaders in the cofig dictionary provided by config along with layer_ids that you would like to get trained customly. Over here, we have mentioned it to be 230 as that is the custom layer that has been inserted in the original model for custom classification. On the contrary, you can also supply the layer's name or list of layer names and the framework will automatically take that into account too. If you want the model to run custom learning rate for different layers, you also need to pass the `is_augmented` argument as `True`. Once you log the model, the automated finetuning starts and it takes care of hyperparameter tuning to finetune your LLM at an increased pace. 

```python 
config["checks"][0].update({'is_automated': True})
config["logging_args"].update({'logging_folder': 'automated_logs'})
model = BertForSequenceClassificationWithIntermediateLayer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
model.to(device)
framework2 = uptrain.Framework(cfg_dict=config)
framework2.log(inputs={'model': [model]})
```

Below, we show the clear difference in the rate of finetuning with an without using Uptrain - facilitated finetuning of LLM.

## Conclusion 
Finetuning an LLM can make pretrained LLMs extremely useful for specific cases. However, finetuning, if not performed carefully, can take up a lot of resources with delayed results. Here at Uptrain, we are aiming to help you observe and improve the ML models in production and this is one such small step towards that.
