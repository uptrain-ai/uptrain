    "**What is Response Completeness wrt context?**: Response Completeness with respect to context refers to the thoroughness with which a model addresses all relevant information within the context of a given question or task. It emphasizes the need for a response that not only accurately answers the question but also considers the broader context and its various dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications, such as customer support inquiries, a complete response should cover all aspects of the customer's query, taking into account specific details, potential follow-up questions, and any relevant contextual information. This ensures a more effective and satisfactory interaction with the user.\n",
