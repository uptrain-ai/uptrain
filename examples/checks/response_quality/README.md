**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source unified platform to evaluate and improve Generative AI applications. We provide grades for 20+ preconfigured checks (covering language, code, embedding use-cases), perform root cause analysis on failure cases and give insights on how to resolve them.
