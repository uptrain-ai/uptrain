    "**What is Response Relevance?**: Response relevance is the measure of how relevant the generated response is to the question asked. It is a measure of how well the response addresses the question asked and if it contains any additional information that is not relevant to the question asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the question asked is \"Can you tell me about the benefits of renewable energy?\", a relevant response would be \"Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.\" An irrelevant response could be \"The concept of electricity dates back to ancient times when people observed static electricity from rubbing certain materials together. It's fascinating how electricity has evolved over the centuries, leading to the development of various technologies.\"\n",
