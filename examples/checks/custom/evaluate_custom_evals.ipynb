This high level of customization enables assessment based on various factors, such as evaluating responses according to specific personas, determining relevance in relation to ground truth, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the question asked is \"How does a car start?\" and the context provided is \"When a driver turns the key or presses the ignition button, this action initiates the engine's rotation, and the fuel and ignition systems work together to start the combustion process, allowing the engine to run independently and the car starts.\" and the response is \"A car starts by pressing the ignition button\". You can use a custom evaluate to evaluate whether a student has answered the question currectly wrt the context and according score them.\n",
