    "**What is Critique Language Evaluation?**: Critique Language Evaluation is a method used to assess the quality and effectiveness of language in a response, focusing on factors such as clarity, coherence, conciseness, and overall communication. It involves analyzing how well the language used in a response conveys the intended message, whether it addresses the question or issue comprehensively, and if it is free from ambiguity or confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user asks a language model, \"Can you recommend a smartphone with a good camera for photography?\" A comprehensive and well-articulated response would not only list a suitable smartphone but also provide additional details such as camera specifications, features, and perhaps considerations for the user's specific photography needs. A critique of the language in this response would assess whether the information is clearly presented, if it directly addresses the user's request, and if it is communicated in a concise and understandable manner. The evaluation would focus on the quality of language use to ensure that the response is not only accurate but also effectively conveys the necessary information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data schema**: The data schema required for this evaluation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name | Description                     |\n",
    "| ----------- | ------------------------------- |\n",
    "| response    | The response given by the model |"
