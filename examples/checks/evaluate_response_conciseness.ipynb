    "**What is Response Conciseness?**: Response conciseness refers to the quality of a generated response in terms of being clear, brief, and to the point. A concise response effectively conveys the necessary information without unnecessary elaboration or verbosity. It focuses on addressing the core of the question or query in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of natural language processing and AI-generated responses, concise answers are valuable as they enhance user experience by delivering information efficiently. Extraneous details or overly complex explanations can lead to decreased clarity and user understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the question is \"What are the advantages of adopting cloud computing?\", a concise response would highlight key benefits without unnecessary details. An example concise response could be: \"Cloud computing offers scalability, cost efficiency, and accessibility to resources over the internet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data schema**: The data schema required for evaluating response conciseness would include the same columns as mentioned in the Response Relevance example:\n",
