    "**What is Critique Tone Evaluation?**: Critique tone evaluation involves assessing the language model's output in terms of the tone used when following or deviating from guidelines. It aims to ensure that the language model not only adheres to guidelines but also communicates its adherence or deviations in an appropriate and respectful manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the context of the appointment booking chatbot, if the LLM decides to redirect a user query to a human agent (as per the guideline), the critique tone evaluation would assess how well the LLM communicates this redirection to the user. A polite and informative tone would be desirable.\n",
