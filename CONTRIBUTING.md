# Contributing to the UpTrain Framework


If you're interested in contributing to the UpTrain repository, we'd love to have you! Here's a more detailed guide on how to get started:

1. First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can make changes to.

2. Next, navigate to the repository on your own account and create a new branch. This is where you'll make your changes and additions. You can do this by running the following command (replacing "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username)
```console
git checkout -b YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/somefeature
```

3. Now it's time to make changes! You can add new files, modify existing files, or delete files that are no longer needed. Once you've made the changes you want, you'll need to add them to a commit. You can do this by running the command `git add filename` for each file name you want to add/update. This will add all changes to the next commit.

4. Now you're ready to commit your changes. You'll need to provide a commit message that briefly describes the changes you've made. You can do this by running the command (replacing "Add something" with a brief description of your changes)
```console
git commit -m 'Add something'
```

5. Finally, you'll need to push your changes to the branch you created in step 2. You can do this by running the command 
```console
git push origin YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/somefeature
```

6. Once your changes are pushed, you can go back to the UpTrain repository on GitHub and make a pull request. This is where you'll describe your changes and ask for them to be reviewed and merged into the main repository.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to UpTrain! We look forward to reviewing your pull request and incorporating your changes ❤️
