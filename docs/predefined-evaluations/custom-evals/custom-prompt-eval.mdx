title: Custom Prompt
description: Grades how well the LLM adheres to a provided guideline when giving a response.
---

Guideline adherence measures the extent to which the generated response follows a given guideline, rule, or protocol. 

Given the complexity of LLMs, it is crucial to define certain guidelines, be it in terms of the structure of the output or the constraints on the content of the output or protocols on the decision-making capabilities of the LLMs.



### GuidelineAdherence  ([Tutorial](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/checks/custom/guideline_adherence.ipynb))

Grades how well the LLM adheres to a provided guideline when giving a response.

Parameters:
- `prompt`:	Evaluation prompt used to generate the grade
- `choices`:	List of choices/grades to choose from
- `choices_scores`:	Scores associated with each choice
- `eval_type`:	One of ["classify", "cot_classify"], determines if chain-of-thought prompting is to be applied or not
- `prompt_var_to_column_mapping (optional)`: mapping between variables defined in the prompt vs column names in the data

### How to use it?

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, GuidelineAdherence

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-********************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here

prompt = """
You are an expert medical school professor specializing in grading students' answers to questions.
You are grading the following question:
{question}
Here is the real answer:
{ground_truth}
You are grading the following predicted answer:
{response}
"""

choices = ["Correct", "Correct but Incomplete", "Incorrect"]
choice_scores = [1.0, 0.5, 0.0]

data = [{
      "user_question": "What causes diabetes?",
      "ground_truth_response": "Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is primarily caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including obesity and lack of physical activity.",
      "user_response": "Diabetes is primarily caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including obesity and lack of physical activity."
}]

prompt_var_to_column_mapping = {
    "question": "user_question",
    "ground_truth": "ground_truth_response",
    "response": "user_response"
}

from uptrain import CustomPromptEval, EvalLLM, Settings
import json

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-*****************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here
eval_llm = EvalLLM(settings=Settings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, response_format={"type":"json_object"}))

results = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data = data,
    checks = [CustomPromptEval(
        prompt = prompt,
        choices = choices,
        choice_scores = choice_scores,
        prompt_var_to_column_mapping = prompt_var_to_column_mapping
    )]
)    
```
<Info>By Default we are using GPT 3.5 Turbo. If you want to use some other model check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/open_source_evaluator_tutorial.ipynb)</Info>

Sample Response:
```json
[
   {
      "Choice": "CORRECT BUT INCOMPLETE",
      "Explanation": "The predicted answer correctly identifies the primary causes of diabetes as genetic and environmental factors, including obesity and lack of physical activity. However, it does not mention that diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, which is an important aspect of the real answer.",
      "score_custom_prompt": 0.5
   }
]
```
<Note>A higher guideline adherence score reflects that the generated response contains adheres to defined guideline.</Note>

Here, we have evaluated the data according to the above mentioned prompt.

The response though correct, does not answers the question completely according to the information provided in the context.
