title: Language Features
description: Grades whether the response has answered all the aspects of the question specified
---

Critique tone evaluation involves assessing the language model's output in terms of the tone used when following or deviating from guidelines. 

It aims to ensure that the language model not only adheres to guidelines but also communicates its adherence or deviations in an appropriate and respectful manner.

Columns required:
- `response`: The response given by the model
- `llm_persona`: The persona the LLM being assessed was exposed to follow

### How to use it?

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, CritiqueTone

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-********************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here

data = [{
    "response": "hey, so quadratic equation solving, I will guide you! just refer to any book on basic algebra it is pretty straightforward, even a dummy can understand."
}]

eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

res = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data = data,
    checks = [Evals.CRITIQUE_LANGUAGE]    
)
```
<Info>By Default we are using GPT 3.5 Turbo. If you want to use some other model check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/open_source_evaluator_tutorial.ipynb)</Info>

Sample Response:
```json
[
   {
      "score_fluency": 0.4,
      "score_coherence": 0.4,
      "score_grammar": 0.4,
      "score_politeness": 0.2,
      "explanation_fluency": "The text is not fluent and sounds awkward due to the informal language and lack of proper structure.",
      "explanation_coherence": "The text lacks coherence as it jumps between different topics without a clear connection.",
      "explanation_grammar": "The text contains grammatical errors and informal language that is not suitable for a professional or academic setting.",
      "explanation_politeness": "The tone is impolite and condescending, using the term \"dummy\" which is inappropriate."
   }
]
```
<Note>Higher language features scores reflects a good response.</Note>

The reponse generated does not seem good, it has innapropriate words like "dummy", there are some grammatical errors and uses unnecessary slangs like: "I will guide you", "it is pretty straightforward"

Resulting in low language feature scores.

### How it works?

We evaluate language features by determining which of the following three cases apply for the given task data across features such as fluent, polite, grammatically correct, and coherent:

* The response is highly rated on these features.
* The response is moderately rated on these features.
* The response is poorly rated on these features.
