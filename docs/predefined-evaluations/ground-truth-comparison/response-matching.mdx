title: Response Matching
description: Grades how relevant the generated context was to the question specified.
---

Response relevance is the measure of how relevant the generated response is to the question asked. 

It helps evaluate how well the response addresses the question asked and if it contains any additional information that is not relevant to the question asked.

Columns required:
- `question`: The question asked by the user
- `response`: The response given by the model
- `ground_truth`: The ideal response

Optional Parameters:
- `method`: Different methods to check for response matching
    * `llm (default)`: Uses LLM to check if the response matches the ground truth 
    * `exact`: Checks if the response is exactly the same as the ground_truth
    * `rouge`: Uses ROUGE SCORE to check if the response matches the ground truth

### How to use it?

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, ResponseMatching

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-********************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here

data = [{
    "question": "Who were the two finalists of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup?",
    "ground_truth": "The finalists of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup were India and Australia.",
    "response": "Australia was a finalist in the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup."
}]

eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

res = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data = data,
    checks = [ResponseMatching(method = 'llm')]    # method: llm/exact/rouge
)
```
<Info>By default, we are using GPT 3.5 Turbo for evaluations. If you want to use a different model, check out this [tutorial](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/examples/open_source_evaluator_tutorial.ipynb).</Info>

Sample Response:
```json
[
   {
      "response_match_precision": 1.0,
      "response_match_recall": 0.5,
      "score_response_match": 0.57,
      "response_match_method": "llm"
   }
]
```
<Note>A higher response matching score reflects that the generated response matches the ground truth.</Note>

The response generated contains information on Australia being a finalist and does not match the ground truth about both the finalists of the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup.

Hence, resulting in a low response matching score.
