title: Number of Turns
description: Counts the number of turns in a conversation.
---

A good chatbot should be able to resolve the user's query in the fewest number of turns possible. The number of turns in a conversation is a key metric to measure the efficiency of the chatbot in resolving the user's query.

This should ideally be used in conjunction with the [Query Resolution](/predefined-evaluations/conversation-evals/query-resolution) evaluation to ensure that the chatbot is able to resolve the user's query in the fewest number of turns. 

Columns required:
- `guideline`: The guideline to be followed
- `guideline_name (optional)`: User-assigned name of the guideline to distinguish between multiple guidelines

### How to use it?

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, ConversationNumberOfTurns

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-********************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here

data = [{
    'conversation' : [
        {"role": "patient", "content": "Hello"},
        {"role": "nurse", "content": "Hello, how can I help you"},
        {"role": "patient", "content": "I am feeling very sick"},
        {"role": "nurse", "content": "What are your symptoms"},
        {"role": "patient", "content": "I have a headache"},
        {"role": "nurse", "content": "Have you taken any medication"},
        {"role": "patient", "content": "No, I haven't"},
        {"role": "nurse", "content": "Please take some paracetamol"},
        {"role": "patient", "content": "Thank you nurse"},
    ]  
}]


eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

res = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data=data,
    checks=[ConversationNumberOfTurns()],
)
```

Sample Response:
```json
{
    "score_conversation_number_of_turns": 5,
    "explanation_conversation_number_of_turns": {
        "Reasoning": [
        "The conversation starts with the patient greeting the nurse.",
        "The patient expresses feeling sick, prompting the nurse to ask about symptoms.",
        "The patient mentions having a headache, leading the nurse to inquire about medication.",
        "The patient confirms not taking any medication, and the nurse advises taking paracetamol.",
        "The patient thanks the nurse, indicating the resolution of the user query.",
        "Therefore, the number of turns in the conversation taken to resolve the user query is 5."
        ],
        "Turns": 5
    }
}
