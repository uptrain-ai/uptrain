## What are Custom Operators?
UpTrain offers a wide range of built-in operators to help you get started with your training pipeline. However, you may want to create your own custom operator to perform a specific task. This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a custom operator.

There are a few things that need to be kept in mind while creating an operator:
1. Operators have two methods: `setup` and `run`
    1. `setup` is called once when the operator is initialized. This is where you can pass in any settings that you need to use in the `run` method.
    2. `run` is called for each batch of data that is passed to the operator. This is where you will perform the actual operation on the data. It returns a dictionary with the key `output` and the value depends on the type of operator. Any extra information can be put in the `extra` key of the dictionary.
2. There are two types of operators: `TransformOp` and `ColumnOp`. 
    1. `TransformOp` represents an operator that transforms the data into another form. 
        - This is used for operations like filtering, cleaning, etc. 
        - The value of the `output` key of the dictionary returned by the `run` method should be a polars.DataFrame or None.
    2. `ColumnOp` represents an operator that adds a new column to the data. 
        - This is used for operations like adding a new column, renaming a column, etc. 
        - The value of the `output` key of the dictionary returned by the `run` method should set as the computed table.
3. The operator should be registered using the `register_custom_op` decorator. 

## Examples

#### Example 1: Cleanup Operator

An Operator that goes through a list of messages and extracts the question, document title, document link, document text, and response from the messages.
```python
from uptrain.operators import TransformOp, register_custom_op

@register_custom_op
class Cleanup(TransformOp):
    def setup(self, settings):
        return self

    def run(self, dataset):
        import json
        import polars as pl

        table_cols = [ 
            "question",
            "document_title",
            "document_link",
            "document_text",
            "response",
        ]
        out = []
        for point in dataset.to_dicts():
            messages = json.loads(point["messages"])
            question = messages[0]["content"].split("The input is: '")[1].split("?")[0]
            name = (
                messages[0]["content"]
                .split("technical documentation titled ")[1]
                .split(", found at")[0]
            )
            link = messages[0]["content"].split("found at ")[1].split(". \n")[0]
            text = (
                messages[0]["content"]
                .split("--- START: Document ---")[1]
                .split(name + "\n")[1]
                .split("\n\n--- END: Document")[0]
            )
            response = messages[1]["content"][1:-1]

            new_row = dict(zip(table_cols, [question, name, link, text, response]))
            out.append(new_row)

        return {"output": pl.from_dicts(out)}
```

#### Example 2: AddContext Operator 

An Operator that adds the model and pipeline name to the data.
```python
from uptrain.operators import TransformOp, register_custom_op

@register_custom_op
class AddContext(TransformOp):
    def setup(self, settings):
        return self

    def run(self, dataset):
        import polars as pl

        return {
            "output": dataset.with_columns(
                [
                    pl.lit("gpt-4").alias("model"),
                    pl.lit("context_retrieval").alias("pipeline"),
                ]
            )
        }
```
