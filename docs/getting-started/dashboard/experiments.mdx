### What are experiments?

You can experiment with UpTrain on 20+ pre-configured evaluation metrics like:
1. [Context Relevance](/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-relevance): Evaluates how relevant the retrieved context is to the question specified.

2. [Factual Accuracy](/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/factual-accuracy): Evaluates whether the response generated is factually correct and grounded by the provided context.

3. [Response Completeness](/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-completeness): Evaluates whether the response has answered all the aspects of the question specified

You can look at the complete list of UpTrain's supported metrics [here](/predefined-evaluations/overview)
