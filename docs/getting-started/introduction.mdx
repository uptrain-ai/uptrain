**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source platform to evaluate and improve your LLM applications. 

We provide scores for 20+ pre-configured evals (and have 40+ operators to help create custom ones), perform root cause analysis on failure cases and give insights on how to resolve them, so that you not only confidently ship AI but also continuosly iterate and improve it.
