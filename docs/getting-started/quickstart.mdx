### Install the package 

Using [full] will install the UpTrain package with all its dependencies

```bash
pip install uptrain[full]
```


### Define your requirement

There are many ways you can use UpTrain. You can set it up based on your requirements. 

Let's say we asked a Large Language Model like ChatGPT to generate responses for given inputs and stored them in a CSV spreadsheet called [responses.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16lln3OWUMCN53IBMytdiZL0uAlKBqgWJn9umpMCeii4/edit?usp=sharing). Now, we want to do the following:

1. Check the grammatical correctness of the generated responses.
2. Calculate the length of each response.


### Choose and create Operators

An [Operator](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/ColumnExpand) runs a function on a given column of data and returns the result in a new column.

In our case, we clearly want to use the `GrammarScore` and `TextLength` Operators. So, we will create them by specifying the input and output coloumn names as follows:

```python
from uptrain.operators import GrammarScore, TextLength

grammar_score = GrammarScore(
    col_in_text="model_response",
    col_out="grammar_correctness_score"
)

text_length = TextLength(
    col_in_text="model_response",
    col_out="response_length"
)
```


### Create the Checks

A [Check](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/framework/Check) runs the given list of operators in the order in which they are specified by the user. We will create a `Check` with the Operators we created above. We will also specify how we want to visualize the results. 

```python
from uptrain.framework import Check

response_analysis = Check(
    name="response_analysis"
    operators=[grammar_score, text_length],
    plot=[Table()]
)
```

Here, we show a table with all the columns and a histogram that depicts the relationship between the length of the responses and their grammatical correctness. 
You can create more than one `Check`, but for the sake of simplicity, we will just create one.


### Configure the Settings

We need to tell UpTrain where we want our results to be stored (logs_folder). Since, the `GrammarScore` uses OpenAI's API, we also need to enter the OpenAI API key. 

To learn more about how to get an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable, check out this [guide](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/adding-your-openai-api-key-to-system-environment-variables). It is recommended to store your API key as an environment variable for security reasons.

We configure the settings for our checks as follows:

```python
import os
from uptrain.framework import Settings

LOGS_DIR = "/tmp/uptrain_logs"
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

settings = Settings(
    logs_folder=LOGS_DIR,
    openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY
)
```


### Create a CheckSet

You can create as many `Check`s as you want and add them to a [CheckSet](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/framework/CheckSet). It will run all the `Check`s and you can view them individually. For now, we just add the response_analysis `Check` we created above. 

Here, we use UpTrain's `CsvReader` to read the content from our CSV file containing the responses.

```python
from uptrain.framework import CheckSet
from uptrain.operators import CsvReader

check_set = CheckSet(
    checks=[grammar_check],
    source=CsvReader(fpath="responses.csv")
)
```


### Set up and run the CheckSet

Now, we will set up the `CheckSet` with the settings we created above and run it. 

```python
check_set.setup(settings)
check_set.run()
```


### Visualize the results

Finally, we use UpTrain's `StreamlitRunner` to visualize the results. 

```python
from uptrain.dashboard import StreamlitRunner

st_runner = StreamlitRunner(LOGS_DIR)
st_runner.start()
```

This will open a new tab in your browser with the UpTrain dashboard. You can view the results of the `Check` we created above.

Here is a screenshot of the dashboard:
