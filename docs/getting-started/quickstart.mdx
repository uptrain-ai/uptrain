### Get your API key

[Sign up](https://uptrain.ai/dashboard) for an UpTrain account and get your API key. You will be provided with 500 free credits to get started. You can also [contact us](https://calendly.com/uptrain-sourabh/uptrain-demo) for a demo or to get more credits.


### Install UpTrain with all dependencies

Run the following commands in your terminal to install UpTrain and all its dependencies:

```bash
pip install uptrain
uptrain-add --feature full
```


### Create an UpTrain API Client

Before we can start using UpTrain, we need to create an API client. You can do this by passing your API key to the `APIClient` constructor.

```python
UPTRAIN_API_KEY = "up-***************"
client = APIClient(uptrain_api_key=UPTRAIN_API_KEY)
```

Note: Alternatively, if you do not wish to create an UpTrain account, you can pass an OpenAI API key as the `openai_api_key` argument to the `APIClient` constructor. These evaluations are also run on UpTrain's infrastructure.

### Create your data

You can define your data as simple dictionary with the following keys:

- `question`: The question you want to ask
- `context`: The context relevant to the question
- `response`: The response to the question

```python
data = [{
    "question": [
        "Which is the most popular global sport?",
        "Who created the Python language?",
    ]
    "context": [
        "The popularity of sports can be measured in various ways, including TV viewership, social media presence, number of participants, and economic impact. Football is undoubtedly the world's most popular sport with major events like the FIFA World Cup and sports personalities like Ronaldo and Messi, drawing a followership of more than 4 billion people.",
        "Python, created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its language constructs aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale software projects.",
    ]
    "response":[
        "Football is the most popular sport with around 4 billion followers worldwide",
        "Python language was created by Guido van Rossum.",
    ]
}]
```


### Log and evaluate your data

Now that we have our data, we can log it and evaluate it using UpTrain. We use the `log_and_evaluate` method to do this. This method takes the following arguments:

- `project_name`: The name of your project
- `data`: The data you want to log and evaluate
- `evals`: The evaluations you want to perform on your data

You can find the list of all available evaluations [here](/key-components/evals).

```python
from uptrain.framework import APIClient, Evals, CritiqueTone
import json

results = client.log_and_evaluate(
    "Sample-Project",
    data,
    [Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE, Evals.FACTUAL_ACCURACY, Evals.RESPONSE_RELEVANCE, CritiqueTone(persona="teacher")]
)
```

### Get your results

```python
print(json.dumps(results, indent=3))
```
