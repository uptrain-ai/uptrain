### Install the package 

Using [full] will install the UpTrain package with all its dependencies

```bash
pip install uptrain[full]
```


### Define your requirement

There are many ways you can use UpTrain. You can set it up based on your requirements. 

Let's say we asked a Large Language Model like ChatGPT to generate responses for given inputs and stored them in a CSV spreadsheet called "responses.csv". Now, we want to do the following:

1. Check the grammatical correctness of the generated responses.
2. Calculate the length of each response.


### Choose and create Operators

An [Operator](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/ColumnExpand) runs a function on a given column of data and returns the result in a new column.

In our case, we clearly want to use the `GrammarScore` and `TextLength` Operators. So, we will create them by specifying the input and output coloumn names as follows:

```python
from uptrain.operators.language import GrammarScore, TextLength

grammar_score = GrammarScore(
    col_in_text = "model_response",
    col_out = "grammar_correctness_score"
)
settings = Settings(openai_api_key = '...')

text_length = TextLength(
    col_in_text = "model_response",
    col_out = "response_length"
)
```


### Create the Checks

A [Check](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/framework/Check) runs the given list of operators in the order in which they are specified by the user. We will create a `Check` with the Operators we created above. We will also specify how we want to visualize the results. 

```python
from uptrain import Check
response_analysis = Check(
    name = "response_analysis"
    operators = [grammar_score, text_length],
    plots = [Table(), Histogram(x = "response_length", y = "grammar_correctness_score")]
)
```

Here, we show a table with all the columns and a histogram that depicts the relationship between the length of the responses and their grammatical correctness. 
You can create more than one `Check`, but for the sake of simplicity, we will just create one.


### Configure the Settings

We need to tell UpTrain where we want our results to be stored (logs_folder). Since, the `GrammarScore` uses OpenAI's API, we also need to specify an API key. You can get your API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

We configure the settings for our checks as follows:

```python
from uptrain.framework import Settings

settings = Settings(
    logs_folder = "/tmp/uptrain_logs",
    openai_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
)
```


### Create a CheckSet

You can create as many `Check`s as you want and add them to a [CheckSet](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/framework/CheckSet). It will run all the `Check`s and you can view them individually. For now, we just add the response_analysis `Check` we created above. 

Here, we use UpTrain's `CsvReader` to read the content from our CSV file containing the responses.

```python
from uptrain.framework import CheckSet
from uptrain.io.readers import CsvReader

check_set = CheckSet(
    checks = [grammar_check],
    source = CsvReader(fpath = "responses.csv")
)
```


### Set up and run the CheckSet

Now, we will set up the `CheckSet` with the settings we created above and run it. 

```python
check_set.setup(settings)
check_set.run()
```


### Visualize the results

Finally, we use UpTrain's `StreamlitRunner` to visualize the results. 

```python
from uptrain.dashboard import StreamlitRunner

st_runner = StreamlitRunner(LOGS_DIR)
st_runner.start()
```
