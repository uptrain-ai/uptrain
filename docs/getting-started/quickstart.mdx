To run it in your machine, follow the steps below:

### Install the package through pip
```bash
pip install uptrain
```

### Define your checks
Say we want to check whether our model's responses contain any grammatical mistakes or not.

```python
# Define your checkset - list of simple checks, dataset file, and api_keys

checkset = CheckSet(
    checks = SimpleCheck(
        name = "grammar_score",
        sequence = [
            SelectOp(
                columns = {
                    "grammar_score": GrammarScore(
                        col_in_text = "model_response",
                        col_out = "grammar_score"
                    ),
                }
            )
        ],
        plot = PlotlyChart.Table(title="Grammar scores"),
    ),
    source = JsonReader(fpath = '...'),
    settings = Settings(openai_api_key = '...')
)

checkset.setup()
checkset.run()
```
