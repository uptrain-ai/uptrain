You can quickly get started with this [example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZIITMB7XYotvhg5CNvGPFnBdM4SR2w4Q?usp=sharing%2F).

To run it on your machine, follow the steps below:

Install the package through pip:

```bash
pip install uptrain
```

Run your first example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uptrain-ai/uptrain.git
cd uptrain/examples
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```
