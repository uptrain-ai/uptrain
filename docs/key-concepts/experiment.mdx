## Experiment

An experiment combines prompt-generation and evaluation. 

The prompt generator is a simple tool to help you generate prompts for your evaluation. It takes a prompt template, 
which is a string with placeholders for variables you might want to tweak, and a list of test values for each variable. 
It then generates a prompt for each combination of values and calls the completion API to generate the output text.

The generated text can then be used as input to your evaluation. Uptrain then generates a Streamlit dashboard to 
visualize the results.
