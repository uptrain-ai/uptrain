Uptrain evaluations are defined as regular table transforms, which we refer to as `Operators`. Each Operator 
is defined as a pydantic model, which specifies:

1. Required input columns in the input dataset and output column names
2. Parameter values to customize the evaluation. For ex, the `Distribution` operator which evaluates ...

Operators implement,
1. A `setup` method (initialize resources, set up API keys, etc.)
2. A `run` method (takes the dataset and computes the evaluation)

Uptrain provides some friendly constructs like a CheckSet and Experiment to make it easy to run multiple evaluations together. However, you 
can just as easily use uptrain operators with your regular data pipelines.
