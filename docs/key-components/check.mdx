title: Check
description: An easy way to chain your operators and create charts

A `Check` in UpTrain runs a series of [Operators](/key-components/operator) in the order in which they are specified.

A `Check` in UpTrain takes three arguments:
1. **name -** The name of the check
2. **operators -** The operators that are to be run when the check is executed
3. **plots -** The [Charts](/key-components/chart) that you want to see generated when the check is executed 

`Checks` can be run on their own by using the `run()` method. However, to make full use of them you can use a [CheckSet](/key-components/checkset) to run all your `Checks` at once.

To learn more about `Checks`, see the [Check Documentation](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/framework/Check/)
