An Operator is used to perform operations on a dataset. They are defined as regular table transforms. Each Operator 
is defined as a pydantic model, which specifies:

1. Required input columns in the input dataset and output column names
2. Parameter values to customize the evaluation. 

Each Operator implements two methods, which are to be run in order:
1. `setup()` - Loads models, sets up file addresses etc.
2. `run()` - Runs the operator. It takes 0 or more Polars DataFrames as input, and returns a dictionary with the `output` key set to the computed DataFrame/None. Any extra information can be found in the `extra` key.

Though operators can be used on their own, they are typically used in [Checks](/key-components/check), that make it easy to add [Charts](/key-components/chart) chain multiple operators together.  Using a `Check`, you won't have to manually perform the `setup()` and `run()` methods.  

To learn more about Operators, see the [Operator documentation](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/Accuracy/).

You can also create your own custom operators.  To learn more, see the [Custom Operator tutorial](/tutorials/custom-operator).
