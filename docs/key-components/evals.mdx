description: Quickest way to perform evaluations on your data
---

UpTrain provides a simple and easy way to perform evaluations on your data. You can pass any of these Evals to the `log_and_evaluate` function and it will automatically perform the evaluation and log the results to the database.

These evals require a combination of the following columns to be present in your data:

- `question`: The question you want to ask
- `context`: The context relevant to the question
- `response`: The response to the question


### FACTUAL_ACCURACY

Grades how factual the generated response was.

Columns required:

- `response`


### RESPONSE_COMPLETENESS_WRT_CONTEXT

Grades how complete the generated response was for the question specified given the information provided in the context.

### CONTEXT_RELEVANCE

### RESPONSE_RELEVANCE

Grades how relevant the generated response is or if it has any additional irrelevant information for the question asked.

Columns required:

### CRITIQUE_LANGUAGE

## Parametric Evals

Parametric evals are evals that require additional parameters to be passed to them. These are used by directly passing an object of the eval class to the `log_and_evaluate` function.
