title: CheckSet
description: The UpTrain equivalent of a test suite
---

A `CheckSet` specifies a collection of [Check](/key-components/check) objects run against the same dataset. It is a higher level construct to make scheduling and running multiple checks easier. 

A `CheckSet` in UpTrain takes three arguments:
1. **source -** The location of the file along with the corresponding [Reader Operator](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/IO/CsvReader/). 
2. **preprocessors -** The list of operators to run on the input data before running the checks.
3. **checks -** The set of checks to be run on the input data after preprocessing.

The `CheckSet` class implements two methods, which are to be run in order:
1. `setup()` - This method performs the setup before the `run()` method is called. You can pass a [Settings](/key-components/settings) object with the required configurations. 
2. `run()` -  Reads the data and runs all the `Checks`

A `CheckSet` object can optionally be serialized and run remotely.
