title: RAG with Citation
description: Helps analyse failure causes in a RAG pipeline.
---

RAG with citation helps you analyse failure causes in a RAG pipeline. Using it you can highlight failure causes such as:
- `Poor Retrieval`: The context does not have information relevant to the question asked.
- `Hallucinations`: The generated response is not factually correct.
- `Poor Citation`: The cited information is not factually correct.
- `Poor Context Utilization`: The cited information is not relevant to the question asked.

Columns required:
- `question`: The question asked by the user
- `context`: Additional information provided that can be used to answer the question
- `cited_context`: Information retieved from the context
- `response`: The response given by the model

### How to use it?

```python
from uptrain import APIClient, RcaTemplate
import json

uptrain_client = APIClient(uptrain_api_key=UPTRAIN_API_KEY)  # Insert your UpTrain key here

data = [{
        'question': 'Which team won the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup?',
        'context': 'Argentina won the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022. The previous FIFA World Cup was held in Russia.',
        'cited_context': 'The 2022 FIFA World Cup took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022',
        'response': 'The 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup was won by Qatar.'        
    }]

res = uptrain_client.perform_root_cause_analysis(
    'Sample-RCA',       # Enter a project name
    data = data,
    rca_template = RcaTemplate.RAG_WITH_CITATION
)

print(json.dumps(res,indent=3))
```

The context does not support or contradict the fact, and the fact cannot be logically derived from the context."
}
]
```

The question asked is "Which team won the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup?".

The context has information about FIFA World Cup, but it has no information on ICC Cricket World Cup.

Thus, the context is not relevant for the question being asked.

Hence, the error mode in this example is `Poor Retrieval`
