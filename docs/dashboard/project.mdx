### What is a Project?

Using UpTrain Dashboard you can manage all your projects.

There are 2 types of projects we support:
  * **Evaluations:** Run evaluations on your datasets
  * **Prompts:** Manage your prompts, evaluate and experiment  

### How does it work?

<Steps>
  <Step title = "Create a new Project">
    Click on `Create New Project` from Home
    <Frame>
      <img src="/assets/dashboard/dashboard_home.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title = "Enter Project Information">
    * `Project name:` Create a name for your project
    * `Dataset name:` Create a name for your dataset
    * `Project Type:` Select a project type between `Evaluations` and `Prompts`
    * `Choose File:` Upload your Dataset
      Sample Dataset:
      ```jsonl
      {"question":"","response":"","context":""}
      {"question":"","response":"","context":""}
      ```
    * `Evaluation LLM:` Select an LLM to run evaluations
    <Frame>
      <img src="/assets/dashboard/dashboard_project1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now that you have created a project, you can run evaluations or experiment with prompts
