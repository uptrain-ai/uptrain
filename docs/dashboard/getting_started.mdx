### What is UpTrain Dashboard?

The UpTrain dashboard is a web-based interface that allows you to evaluate your LLM applications. 

It is a self-hosted dashboard that runs on your local machine. You don't need to write any code to use the dashboard. 

You can use the dashboard to evaluate your LLM applications, view the results, manage prompts, run experiments, and perform root cause analysis.

<Note>Before you start, ensure you have docker installed on your machine. If not, you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). </Note>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain
cd uptrain

# Run UpTrain
