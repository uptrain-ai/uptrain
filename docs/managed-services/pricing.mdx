We charge a flat rate of 1 credit for every evaluation performed on a single data point. 

There are two ways you can use the API:
1. **Using the `evaluate` method** - This method is used to run a single evaluation on a dataset. The number of credits one will be charged is equal to the number of rows in the dataset. For example, if you have a dataset with 100 rows, you will be charged 100 credits.

2. **Using the `add_run` method** - This method is used to run multiple evaluations on a dataset. The number of credits one will be charged is equal to the number of rows in the dataset multiplied by the number of evaluations. For example, if you have a dataset with 100 rows and you want to run 3 evaluations, you will be charged 300 credits.

You can purchase credits in bulk. The more credits you purchase, the cheaper it gets. [Book a demo](https://calendly.com/uptrain-sourabh/uptrain-demo) with us to get a quote.
