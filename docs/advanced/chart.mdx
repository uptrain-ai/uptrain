UpTrain offers a variety of charts using the Plotly library. The best way to use these is to specify them along with your [Operators](/key-components/operator) in a [Check](/key-components/check).

To check out all the charts available in UpTrain and how to use them, see [Chart Documentation](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/charts/BarChart/).
