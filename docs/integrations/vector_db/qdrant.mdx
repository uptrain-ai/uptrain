[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database. While working on RAG based applications, you can use QDrant to retrieve information from your context documents.

### How will this help?

Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling fast and efficient similarity search and retrieval of data based on their vector representations.
You can use UpTrain along with vector databases such as QDrant for evaluations such as the relevance of the retrieved context ensuring a good retrieval quality.

### How to integrate?

First, let's import the necessary packages

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, Evals, APIClient
from qdrant_client import models, QdrantClient
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import json
```

Let's define a dataset to create embeddings

```python
texts = [
    {
        "name": "A Gift From The Stars",
        "description": "This is the true story of an abduction and a rescue by benevolent extraterrestrials, various direct contacts Elena Danaan had throughout the years with UFOs and visitors from other worlds.",
        "author": "Elena Dannan",
        "year": 2020,
    },
    {
        "name": "The Royal Abduction",
        "description": "Shreya Singh, a princess from Rajasthan, has been abducted! A woman of beauty and substance, she is living a lavish life. But while there are abundant riches in her palace, there are also dark secrets about her family buried in the past.",
        "author": "Vikram Singh",
        "year": 2023,
    }
]
```

Creating a memory instance using QDrant:

```python
encoder = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")     # Create sentence transformer model to generate embeddings

qdrant = QdrantClient(":memory:")     # Create in-memory Qdrant instance


qdrant.recreate_collection(     # Create collection to store books
    collection_name="my_books",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=encoder.get_sentence_embedding_dimension(),
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
    )
)
```

Generate embedding and vectorise from the defined text

```python
embeddings = encoder.encode(texts)      # Generate embeddings for the texts

qdrant.upload_points(     # Upload embeddings to the specified collection
    collection_name="my_books",
    points=[
        models.Record(id=idx, vector=embedding.tolist())
        for idx, embedding in enumerate(embeddings)
    ],
)

qdrant.upload_points(     # Vectorize descriptions and upload to qdrant
    collection_name="my_books",
    points=[
        models.Record(
            id=idx, vector=encoder.encode(doc["description"]).tolist(), payload=doc
        )
        for idx, doc in enumerate(texts)
    ],
)
```

Define question and fetch relevant information from Qdrant

```python
question = "What are some books that talk about alien abductions?"

hits = qdrant.search(
    collection_name="my_books", query_vector=encoder.encode(question).tolist()
)

```

Create a list with the fetched information to perform evaluations

```python
data = []
for hit in hits:
    data.append(
        {
            "question": question,
            "context": "Book Description for "
            + hit.payload.get("name", "")
            + " : "
            + hit.payload.get("description", ""),
        }
    )
```

Evaluate the retrieval quality using UpTrain

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-*****************"  # Insert your OpenAI key here

eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

res = eval_llm.evaluate(
                        data=data,
                        checks=[Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE]
)

print(json.dumps(res, indent=3))
```


Let's look at the retrieval quality of the context documents
```json
[
   {
      "question": "What are some books that talk about alien abductions?",
      "context": "Book Description for A Gift From The Stars : This is the true story of an abduction and a rescue by benevolent extraterrestrials, various direct contacts Elena Danaan had throughout the years with UFOs and visitors from other worlds.",
      "score_context_relevance": 1.0,
      "explanation_context_relevance": "The extracted context provides a specific book description that directly addresses the question about books on alien abductions. Hence, the selected choice is (A)"
   },
   {
      "question": "What are some books that talk about alien abductions?",
      "context": "Book Description for The Royal Abduction : Shreya Singh, a princess from Rajasthan, has been abducted! A woman of beauty and substance, she is living a lavish life. But while there are abundant riches in her palace, there are also dark secrets about her family buried in the past.",
      "score_context_relevance": 0.0,
      "explanation_context_relevance": "The extracted context does not contain any information about books that talk about alien abductions. It discusses a book called 'The Royal Abduction' which is about a princess being abducted, but it does not relate to alien abductions. Therefore, the selected choice is (C)"
   }
]
```

According to these evaluations:
1. The first document has context relevant to the question, as it contains information about a book which is related to alien abductions, thus resulting in a good context relevance score.
2. The second document contains information about a book which is related to abduction of a princess but not related to alien abductions, thus resulting in a good context relevance score.
