title: LlamaIndex Overview 
---
[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting
custom data sources to large language models.

### What's the key problem?

1. The data that most Large Language Models are trained on is not representative of the data that they are used on. This leads to a mismatch between the training and test distributions, which can lead to poor performance.
2. The results generated by Large Language Models are not always reliable. The responses might not be relevant to the prompt, not align with the desired tone or the context, or might be offensive etc.

### How will this integration help?

1. LlamaIndex solves the first problem by allowing you to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a retriever that is fine-tuned on your own data. This allows you to use your own data to fine-tune a retriever, and then use that retriever to perform RAG.
2. UpTrain solves the second problem by allowing you to perform evaluations on the generated responses. This helps you to ensure that the responses are relevant to the prompt, align with the desired tone or the context, and are not offensive etc.

### How to integrate?

There two ways you can use UpTrain with LlamaIndex:

1. [Using the UpTrain Callback Handler:](/integrations/framework/llamaindex-methods/callback_handler/overview) This method allows you to seamlessly integrate UpTrain with LlamaIndex. You can simply add UpTrainCallbackHandler to your existing LlamaIndex pipeline and it will take care of sending the generated responses to the UpTrain Managed Service for evaluations. This is the recommended method as it is the easiest to use and provides you with dashboards and insights with minimal effort.

2. [Using UpTrain's EvalLlamaIndex:](/integrations/framework/llamaindex-methods/evalllamaindex) This method allows you to use UpTrain to perform evaluations on the generated responses. You can use the EvalLlamaIndex object to generate responses for the queries and then perform evaluations on the responses. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this below. This method offers more flexibility and control over the evaluations, but requires more effort to set up and use.
