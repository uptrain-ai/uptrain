description: Simple guide to help improve our documentation
---

There are two ways to contribute to our documentation. You can either do it directly from this website or you can clone the repository and run the website locally.

We recommend that you use the first method if you want to make small changes to the documentation. However, if you want to make a bigger change, you can clone the repository and run the website locally.

## Directly from this documentation website 

You can create a pull request or an issue for any page, directly from this website. This is the easiest way to contribute to our documentation.

There are two icons on the top right corner of each page. The left one is for opening a pull request and the right one is for opening an issue.

This is convenient for small changes where you don't need to clone the repository and run the website locally.

## Locally

However, if you want to make a bigger change, you can clone the repository and run the website locally by following the instructions below.

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can make changes to.

2. Clone the repository to your local system (replace "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" with your GitHub username)
```console
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/uptrain
```

3. Run `cd uptrain` to change your current working directory and run the following command to create a new branch: 
```console
git checkout -b YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/somefeature
```

4. Before you get started, you'll need to install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:
```console
npm i -g mintlify
mintlify install
```

5. Navigate to the docs folder using `cd docs` and run the following command to start the development server:
```console
mintlify dev
```

6. Now it's time to make changes! You can add new files, modify existing files, or delete files that are no longer needed and preview them in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

7. Once you've made the changes you want, you'll need to add them to a commit. You can do this by running the command `git add filename` for each file name you want to add/update. This will add all changes to the next commit.

8. Now you're ready to commit your changes. You'll need to provide a commit message that briefly describes the changes you've made. (replace "Add something" with a brief description of your changes)
```console
git commit -m 'Add something'
```

9. Finally, you'll need to push your changes to the branch you created in step 3. You can do this by running the command (using `HEAD` will prevent you from accidentally pushing to the wrong remote branch. ) 
```console
git push origin HEAD
```

10. Once your changes are pushed, you can go back to the UpTrain repository on GitHub and make a pull request. This is where you'll describe your changes and ask for them to be reviewed and merged into the main repository.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to UpTrain! We look forward to reviewing your pull request and incorporating your changes ❤️
