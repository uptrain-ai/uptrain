Measurables in UpTrain are a set of predefined and custom metrics that allow you to track your model's performance. They can be used to evaluate the accuracy of a model, measure the distance between predicted and actual values, and evaluate the impact of model predictions on business outcomes.

UpTrain provides a set of predefined measurables that can be used to track your model's performance. In addition, you can create custom measurables to track any metric you want.

This documentation is split into two parts, the first part will describe the predefined measurables, and the second part will cover how to create custom measurables.
