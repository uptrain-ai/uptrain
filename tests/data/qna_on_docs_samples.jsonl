{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"What is serializable session state?","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/serializable-session-state#pickle.PicklingError","document_text":"## Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)","answer":"erialization

The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.\n# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.\n# Default: false\ndisableWatchdogWarning = false\n\n# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via \"python my_script.py\".\n# Default: true\nshowWarningOnDirectExecution = true\n\n# DataFrame serialization.\n# Acceptable values: - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow but battle-tested. - 'arrow': Serialize DataFrames using Apache Arrow. Much faster and versatile.\n# Default: \"arrow\"\ndataFrameSerialization = \"arrow\"\n\n\n[logger]\n\n# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.\n# Default: 'info'\nlevel = \"info\"\n\n# String format for logging messages.

By default, this is set to True and Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.\n# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and tracebacks will be printed to the console only.\n# Default: true\nshowErrorDetails = true\n\n# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu, and settings dialog (top right of the app).\n# Allowed values:\n# \"auto\" : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through localhost and hide them otherwise.\n# \"developer\" : Show the developer options.\n# \"viewer\" : Hide the developer options.\n# \"minimal\" : Show only options set externally (e.g. through Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.

This makes Streamlit much more responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state assignment statements.\n# Default: true\nfastReruns = true\n\n# Raise an exception after adding unserializable data to Session State.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Add statefulness to apps","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state#caveats-and-limitations","document_text":"## Advanced concepts\n\n### Session State and Widget State association\n\nSession State provides the functionality to store variables across reruns. Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\nThere is a limitation to setting widget values using the Session State API.\n\nThe following example will raise a `StreamlitAPIException` on trying to set the state of `st.button` via the Session State API:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif 'my_button' not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.my_button = True\n    # Streamlit will raise an Exception on trying to set the state of button\n\nst.button('Submit', key='my_button')\n\n```\n![state-button-exception](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/state_button_exception.png)### Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None,

This takes precedence over the figure's native width value.\n- sharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'}): Use 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies directly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default). Use any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which requires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design. The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

{"question":"Can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.8.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.8.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/docs/main/python/api-examples-source/charts.plotly_chart.py) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"es, you can create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit using Plotly.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"here is an example in the documentation that creates histograms with different bucket colors:\n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n>  \n> \n","question_idx":1,"row_idx":15,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":15,"Template":0,"persona":"bot","response":"| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.4.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

This takes precedence over the figure's native width value.\n- sharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'}): Use 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies directly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default). Use any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which requires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design. The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

{"question":"How can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.11.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.11.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L67 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://doc-plotly-chart.streamlit.app/) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custom colorscale\")\ndf = px.data.iris()\nf","answer":"Display an interactive Plotly chart.\"\n\n\"Plotly is a charting library for Python.\"\n\n\"The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function.\"\n\n\"import streamlit as st\"\n\n\"The example below comes straight from the examples at <https://plot.ly/python>\"\n\n\"st.plotly_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\"\n\n\"The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.7.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.6.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\n\n st.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Advanced features","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features#advanced-notes-on-widget-behavior","document_text":"## ","answer":"##### Caching\n\nThe Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators: `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`.\n\n* [Minimal example](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#minimal-example)\n* [Basic usage](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#basic-usage)\n\t+ [st.cache\\_data](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#stcache_data)\n\t+ [st.cache\\_resource](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#stcache_resource)\n\t+ [Deciding which caching decorator to use](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#deciding-which-caching-decorator-to-use)\n* [Advanced usage](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#advanced-usage)\n\t+ [Excluding input parameters](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#excluding-input-parameters)\n\t+ [Controlling cache size and duration](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#controlling-cache-size-and-duration)\n\t+ [Customizing the spinner](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#customizing-the-spinner)\n\t+ [Using Streamlit commands in cached functions](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#using-streamlit-commands-in-cached-functions)\n\t+ [Mutation and concurrency issues](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#mutation-and-concurrency-issues)\n* [Migrating from st.cache](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#migrating-from-stcache)](https://docs.stre","question_idx":2,"row_idx":23,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":23,"Template":0,"persona":"bot","response":"Function signature:\n```\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\n```\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None,

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Widget updating for every second input when using session state","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/widget-updating-session-state#relevant-resources","document_text":"## Solution\n\nWhen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you assigned your widget to. In the example code block below, the unique *key* assigned to the slider widget is `slider`, and the *variable* the widget is assigned to is `slide_val`.\n\nLet's see this in an example. Say you want a user to click a button that resets a slider.\n\nTo have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a [callback function](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state) with the `on_click` parameter of [`st.button`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button):\n\n\n```\n# the callback function for the button will add 1 to the\n# slider value up to 10\ndef plus_one():\n    if st.session_state[\"slider\"] < 10:\n        st.session_state.slider += 1\n    else:\n        pass\n    return\n\n# when creating the button, assign the name of your callback\n# function to the on_click parameter\nadd_one = st.button(\"Add one to the slider\", on_click=plus_one, key=\"add_one\")\n\n# create the slider\nslide_val = st.slider(\"Pick a number\", 0, 10, key=\"slider\")\n\n```\n","answer":"hen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you

{"question":"How can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.5.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.5.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/docs/main/python/api-examples-source/charts.plotly_chart.py) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default...The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.4.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custo","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure_or_data (plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,) | dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nuse_container_width (bool)\nsharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n**kwargs (null)\n\nExample:\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subh","answer":"unction signature\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\n\n### Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\n\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n\n### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server.

Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.

{"question":"Can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"Create an app","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app#plot-data-on-a-map","document_text":"## Draw a histogram\n\nNow that you've had a chance to take a look at the dataset and observe what's\navailable, let's take things a step further and draw a histogram to see what\nUber's busiest hours are in New York City.\n\n1. To start, let's add a subheader just below the raw data section:\n\n\n```\nst.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')\n\n```\n2. Use NumPy to generate a histogram that breaks down pickup times binned by\nhour:\n\n\n```\nhist_values = np.histogram(\n    data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]\n\n```\n3. Now, let's use Streamlit's\n[`st.bar_chart()`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.bar_chart) method to draw this\nhistogram.\n\n\n```\nst.bar_chart(hist_values)\n\n```\n4. Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more. For a full list, see\n[supported charting libraries](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts).\n\n","answer":".

This takes precedence over the figure's native width value.\n- sharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'}): Use 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies directly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default). Use any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which requires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n- \\*\\*kwargs (null): Any argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design. The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"What is serializable session state?","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/serializable-session-state#pickle.PicklingError","document_text":"## Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)","answer":"erialization

The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.\n# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.\n# Default: false\ndisableWatchdogWarning = false\n\n# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via \"python my_script.py\".\n# Default: true\nshowWarningOnDirectExecution = true\n\n# DataFrame serialization.\n# Acceptable values: - 'legacy': Serialize DataFrames using Streamlit's custom format. Slow but battle-tested. - 'arrow': Serialize DataFrames using Apache Arrow. Much faster and versatile.\n# Default: \"arrow\"\ndataFrameSerialization = \"arrow\"\n\n\n[logger]\n\n# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.\n# Default: 'info'\nlevel = \"info\"\n\n# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`.

By default, this is set to True and Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.\n# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and tracebacks will be printed to the console only.\n# Default: true\nshowErrorDetails = true\n\n# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu, and settings dialog (top right of the app).\n# Allowed values:\n# \"auto\" : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through localhost and hide them otherwise.\n# \"developer\" : Show the developer options.\n# \"viewer\" : Hide the developer options.\n# \"minimal\" : Show only options set externally (e.g. through Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.

As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.\n# Default: false\ninstallTracer = false\n\n# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.\n# Default: true\nfixMatplotlib = true\n\n# Run the Python Garbage Collector after each script execution.

This makes Streamlit much more responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state assignment statements.\n# Default: true\nfastReruns = true\n\n# Raise an exception after adding unserializable data to Session State.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Add statefulness to apps","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state#caveats-and-limitations","document_text":"## Advanced concepts\n\n### Session State and Widget State association\n\nSession State provides the functionality to store variables across reruns. Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\nThere is a limitation to setting widget values using the Session State API.\n\nThe following example will raise a `StreamlitAPIException` on trying to set the state of `st.button` via the Session State API:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif 'my_button' not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.my_button = True\n    # Streamlit will raise an Exception on trying to set the state of button\n\nst.button('Submit', key='my_button')\n\n```\n![state-button-exception](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/state_button_exception.png)### Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"es, you can create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit using Plotly.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"here is an example in the documentation that creates histograms with different bucket colors:\n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n>  \n> \n","question_idx":1,"row_idx":15,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":16,"Template":0,"persona":"Streamlit expert","response":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python.

Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\n\n### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server. As soon as you close the tab,

Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n```\n\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custom colorscale\")\ndf = px.data.iris()\nf","answer":"Display an interactive Plotly chart.\"\n\n\"Plotly is a charting library for Python.\"\n\n\"The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function.\"\n\n\"import streamlit as st\"\n\n\"The example below comes straight from the examples at <https://plot.ly/python>\"\n\n\"st.plotly_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\"\n\n\"The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"Can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.6.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.6.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\n\n st.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Widget updating for every second input when using session state","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/widget-updating-session-state#relevant-resources","document_text":"## Solution\n\nWhen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you assigned your widget to. In the example code block below, the unique *key* assigned to the slider widget is `slider`, and the *variable* the widget is assigned to is `slide_val`.\n\nLet's see this in an example. Say you want a user to click a button that resets a slider.\n\nTo have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a [callback function](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state) with the `on_click` parameter of [`st.button`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button):\n\n\n```\n# the callback function for the button will add 1 to the\n# slider value up to 10\ndef plus_one():\n    if st.session_state[\"slider\"] < 10:\n        st.session_state.slider += 1\n    else:\n        pass\n    return\n\n# when creating the button, assign the name of your callback\n# function to the on_click parameter\nadd_one = st.button(\"Add one to the slider\", on_click=plus_one, key=\"add_one\")\n\n# create the slider\nslide_val = st.slider(\"Pick a number\", 0, 10, key=\"slider\")\n\n```\n","answer":"hen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you assigned your widget to.\n\nTo have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a [callback function](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state) with the `on_click` parameter of [`st.button`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button):\n``","question_idx":2,"row_idx":24,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":25,"Template":0,"persona":"Streamlit expert","response":"```\nst.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')\n```\n\n```\nhist_values = np.histogram(\n    data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]\n```\n\n```\nst.bar_chart(hist_values)\n```\n\n\"To draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's important to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like Altair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.5.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default...The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.4.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://static.streamlit.io/0.56.0-xTAd/index.html?id=TuP96xX8JnsoQeUGAPjkGQ) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custo","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure_or_data (plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,) | dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nuse_container_width (bool)\nsharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n**kwargs (null)\n\nExample:\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subh","answer":"unction signature\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

To start, let's add a subheader just below the raw data section:\n\n\n```\nst.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')\n\n```\n2. Use NumPy to generate a histogram that breaks down pickup times binned by\nhour:\n\n\n```\nhist_values = np.histogram(\n    data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]\n\n```\n3. Now, let's use Streamlit's\n[`st.bar_chart()`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts/st.bar_chart) method to draw this\nhistogram.\n\n\n```\nst.bar_chart(hist_values)\n\n```\n4. Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.

Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"What is serializable session state?","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/serializable-session-state#pickle.PicklingError","document_text":"## Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)","answer":"erialization

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Add statefulness to apps","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state#caveats-and-limitations","document_text":"## Advanced concepts\n\n### Session State and Widget State association\n\nSession State provides the functionality to store variables across reruns. Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\nThere is a limitation to setting widget values using the Session State API.\n\nThe following example will raise a `StreamlitAPIException` on trying to set the state of `st.button` via the Session State API:\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif 'my_button' not in st.session_state:\n    st.session_state.my_button = True\n    # Streamlit will raise an Exception on trying to set the state of button\n\nst.button('Submit', key='my_button')\n\n```\n![state-button-exception](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/state_button_exception.png)### Serializable Session State\n\nSerialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the dataâ€™s original structure. Pythonâ€™s built-in [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module serializes Python objects to a byte stream (\"pickling\") and deserializes the stream into an object (\"unpickling\").\n\nBy default, Streamlitâ€™s [Session State](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/session-state) allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the objectâ€™s pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.\n\nTo that end, Streamlit provides a `runner.enforceSerializableSessionState` [configuration option](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration) that, when set to `true`, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:\n\n\n```\n# .streamlit/config.toml\n[runner]\nenforceSerializableSessionState = true\n\n```\nBy \"*pickle-serializable*\", we mean calling `pickle.dumps(obj)` should not raise a [`PicklingError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.PicklingError) exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,\n\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndef unserializable_data():\n        return lambda x: x\n\n#ðŸ‘‡ results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on\nst.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()\n\n```\n![UnserializableSessionStateError](https://docs.streamlit.io/images/unserializable-session-state-error.png)### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server.

{"question":"Can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.8.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.8.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/docs/main/python/api-examples-source/charts.plotly_chart.py) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"es, you can create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit using Plotly.

Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.\n\nFor simplicity, we have *unified* this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the `key` argument.\n\nWe illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can **set** and **get** the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:\n\n```\nimport streamlit as st\n\nif \"celsius\" not in st.session_state:\n    # set the initial default value of the slider widget\n    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0\n\nst.slider(\n    \"Temperature in Celsius\",\n    min_value=-100.0,\n    max_value=100.0,\n    key=\"celsius\"\n)\n\n# This will get the value of the slider widget\nst.write(st.session_state.celsius)\n\n```\n\n### Caveats and limitations\n\nHere are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:\n\n* Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server. As soon as you close the tab,

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.9.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"here is an example in the documentation that creates histograms with different bucket colors:\n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n>  \n> \n","question_idx":1,"row_idx":15,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":17,"Template":0,"persona":"developer","response":"Function signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.11.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L67 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custom colorscale\")\ndf = px.data.iris()\nf","answer":"Display an interactive Plotly chart.\"\n\n\"Plotly is a charting library for Python.\"\n\n\"The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function.\"\n\n\"import streamlit as st\"\n\n\"The example below comes straight from the examples at <https://plot.ly/python>\"\n\n\"st.plotly_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\"\n\n\"The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

{"question":"How can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.7.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.7.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/docs/main/python/api-examples-source/charts.plotly_chart.py) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"Can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.6.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.6.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\n\n st.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Advanced features","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features#advanced-notes-on-widget-behavior","document_text":"## ","answer":"##### Caching\n\nThe Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators: `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`.\n\n* [Minimal example](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#minimal-example)\n* [Basic usage](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#basic-usage)\n\t+ [st.cache\\_data](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#stcache_data)\n\t+ [st.cache\\_resource](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#stcache_resource)\n\t+ [Deciding which caching decorator to use](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#deciding-which-caching-decorator-to-use)\n* [Advanced usage](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#advanced-usage)\n\t+ [Excluding input parameters](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#excluding-input-parameters)\n\t+ [Controlling cache size and duration](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#controlling-cache-size-and-duration)\n\t+ [Customizing the spinner](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#customizing-the-spinner)\n\t+ [Using Streamlit commands in cached functions](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#using-streamlit-commands-in-cached-functions)\n\t+ [Mutation and concurrency issues](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#mutation-and-concurrency-issues)\n* [Migrating from st.cache](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching#migrating-from-stcache)](https://docs.stre","question_idx":2,"row_idx":23,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":25,"Template":0,"persona":"developer","response":"Function signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nExample:\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None,

{"question":"How to use the sessionstate feature in Streamlit","document_title":"Widget updating for every second input when using session state","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/widget-updating-session-state#relevant-resources","document_text":"## Solution\n\nWhen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you assigned your widget to. In the example code block below, the unique *key* assigned to the slider widget is `slider`, and the *variable* the widget is assigned to is `slide_val`.\n\nLet's see this in an example. Say you want a user to click a button that resets a slider.\n\nTo have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a [callback function](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state) with the `on_click` parameter of [`st.button`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button):\n\n\n```\n# the callback function for the button will add 1 to the\n# slider value up to 10\ndef plus_one():\n    if st.session_state[\"slider\"] < 10:\n        st.session_state.slider += 1\n    else:\n        pass\n    return\n\n# when creating the button, assign the name of your callback\n# function to the on_click parameter\nadd_one = st.button(\"Add one to the slider\", on_click=plus_one, key=\"add_one\")\n\n# create the slider\nslide_val = st.slider(\"Pick a number\", 0, 10, key=\"slider\")\n\n```\n","answer":"hen using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, **not** the variable that you assigned your widget to.\n\nTo have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a [callback function](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/session-state#use-callbacks-to-update-session-state) with the `on_click` parameter of [`st.button`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.button):\n``","question_idx":2,"row_idx":24,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","idx":26,"Template":0,"persona":"developer","response":"| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.7.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

{"question":"How can I create histograms with different bucket colors in Streamlit","document_title":"API reference","document_link":"https://docs.streamlit.io/1.5.0/library/api-reference/charts/st.plotly_chart#stplotly_chart","document_text":"## st.plotly\\_chart\n\nDisplay an interactive Plotly chart.\n\n\nPlotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.5.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account. See <https://plotly.com/chart-studio/> for more information.\n |\n| \n\n\\*\\*kwargs\n(null)\n | \nAny argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.\n |\n\n#### Example\n\n\n> \n> The example below comes straight from the examples at\n> <https://plot.ly/python>:\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> \n> import streamlit as st\n> import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n> import numpy as np\n> \n> # Add histogram data\n> x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\n> x2 = np.random.randn(200)\n> x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n> \n> # Group data together\n> hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n> \n> group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n> \n> # Create distplot with custom bin_size\n> fig = ff.create_distplot(\n>          hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n> \n> # Plot!\n> st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n> \n> ```\n> \n> \n> [(view standalone Streamlit app)](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/docs/main/python/api-examples-source/charts.plotly_chart.py) \n> \n\n\n### Theming\n\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subhe","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nExample:\n```\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n```\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default...The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument.

The arguments to this function\nclosely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find\nmore about Plotly at <https://plot.ly/python>.\n\n\nTo show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly\\_chart wherever you\nwould call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.\n\n\n\n\n| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.4.0/lib/streamlit/elements/plotly_chart.py#L42 \"View st.plotly_chart source code on GitHub\") |\n| --- |\n|  st.plotly\\_chart(figure\\_or\\_data, use\\_container\\_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs) |\n| Parameters |\n| \n\nfigure\\_or\\_data\n(plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure, plotly.graph\\_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph\\_objs.Figure/Data\nSee <https://plot.ly/python/> for examples of graph descriptions.\n |\n| \n\nuse\\_container\\_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes\nprecedence over the figure's native width value.\n |\n| \n\nsharing\n({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n | \nUse 'streamlit' to insert the plot and all its dependencies\ndirectly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default).\nUse any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which\nrequires an account.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subheader(\"Define a custo","answer":"unction signature:\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", **kwargs)\n\nParameters:\nfigure_or_data (plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,) | dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\nuse_container_width (bool)\nsharing ({'streamlit', 'private', 'secret', 'public'})\n**kwargs (null)\n\nExample:\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Add histogram data\nx1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2\nx2 = np.random.randn(200)\nx3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2\n\n# Group data together\nhist_data = [x1, x2, x3]\n\ngroup_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']\n\n# Create distplot with custom bin_size\nfig = ff.create_distplot(\n         hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])\n\n# Plot!\nst.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)\n\nTheming:\nPlotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default.

This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.\n\nThe Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the `theme=\"streamlit\"` keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use `theme=None` instead.\n\nLet's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\ndf = px.data.gapminder()\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n    df.query(\"year==2007\"),\n    x=\"gdpPercap\",\n    y=\"lifeExp\",\n    size=\"pop\",\n    color=\"continent\",\n    hover_name=\"country\",\n    log_x=True,\n    size_max=60,\n)\n\ntab1, tab2 = st.tabs([\"Streamlit theme (default)\", \"Plotly native theme\"])\nwith tab1:\n    # Use the Streamlit theme.\n    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=\"streamlit\", use_container_width=True)\nwith tab2:\n    # Use the native Plotly theme.\n    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)\n\n```\nClick the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.\n\nIf you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!\n\nHere's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:\n\n\n```\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.subh","answer":"unction signature\nst.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing=\"streamlit\", \\*\\*kwargs)\n\nParameters\n\nfigure_or_data\n(plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,)\n | \ndict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data\n\nuse_container_width\n(bool)\n | \nIf True, set the chart width to the column width.

Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.

Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away.\nAfter a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).\n\nTo draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native `bar_chart()` method, but it's\nimportant to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like\nAltair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more.
