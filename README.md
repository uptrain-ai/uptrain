**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source unified platform to evaluate and improve Generative AI applications. We provide grades for 20+ preconfigured checks (covering language, code, embedding use-cases), perform root cause analysis on failure cases and give insights on how to resolve them.

# Key Features üîë

<img width="1088" alt="Data Security" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/7b737bfc-b061-4f87-b51e-5bad67879332">

All the evaluations and analysis run locally on your system, ensuring that the data never leaves your secure environment (except for LLM calls while using model grading checks)

<img width="1088" alt="Experimentation" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/fd9c5c7f-3951-4d69-9b77-4fece6ff0830">

**Experiment with different embedding models** like text-embedding-3-large/small, text-embedding-3-ada, baai/bge-large, etc. UpTrain supports HuggingFace models, Replicate endpoints, or custom models hosted on your endpoint.

<img width="1088" alt="Cost Effective" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/8b9bc91b-389a-4664-88f6-11b9c91e1e0f">

By leveraging model grading and introducing an 'Unclear' grade, we are able to leverage GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 as the default evaluator and get high quality yet cost effective scores.

<img width="1088" alt="Root Cause Analysis" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/32df049c-c0a4-4377-a807-f74e2efa57b5">

You can **perform root cause analysis** on cases with either negative user feedback or low evaluation scores to understand which part of your LLM pipeline is giving suboptimal results. Check out the supported RCA templates.

<img width="1088" alt="Configure your own evaluation LLM" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/b87c75b1-b86d-4770-8d37-e8428d5f17c2">

We allow you to use any of OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Azure's Openai endpoints or open-source LLMs hosted on Anyscale to be used as evaluator.

<img width="1088" alt="Customize Evaluations" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/167488ec-9feb-48a7-9659-7bb9478584f9">

UpTrain provides tons of ways to **customize evaluations**. You can customize evaluation method (chain of thought vs classify), few shot examples, add scenario description, as well as create custom evaluators.

<img width="1088" alt="40+ Operators Supported" src="https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/assets/43818888/55d99fb9-ce0a-409f-b898-acb550fa0804">

Support for **40+ operators** such as BLEU, ROUGE, Embeddings Similarity, Exact match, etc.


### Coming Soon:

1. Experiment Dashboards
2. Collaborate with your team
3. Embedding visualization via UMAP and Clustering
4. Pattern recognition among failure cases
5. Prompt improvement suggestions

# Get started üôå

### Install the package through pip:
```bash
pip install uptrain
```

### How to use UpTrain:

You can evaluate your responses via the open-source version by providing your OpenAI API key to run evaluations.

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, Evals
import json

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-***************"

data = [{
    'question': 'Which is the most popular global sport?',
    'context': "The popularity of sports can be measured in various ways, including TV viewership, social media presence, number of participants, and economic impact. Football is undoubtedly the world's most popular sport with major events like the FIFA World Cup and sports personalities like Ronaldo and Messi, drawing a followership of more than 4 billion people. Cricket is particularly popular in countries like India, Pakistan, Australia, and England. The ICC Cricket World Cup and Indian Premier League (IPL) have substantial viewership. The NBA has made basketball popular worldwide, especially in countries like the USA, Canada, China, and the Philippines. Major tennis tournaments like Wimbledon, the US Open, French Open, and Australian Open have large global audiences. Players like Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Rafael Nadal have boosted the sport's popularity. Field Hockey is very popular in countries like India, Netherlands, and Australia. It has a considerable following in many parts of the world.",
    'response': 'Football is the most popular sport with around 4 billion followers worldwide'
}]

eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

results = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data=data,
    checks=[Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE, Evals.FACTUAL_ACCURACY, Evals.RESPONSE_COMPLETENESS]
)

print(json.dumps(results, indent=3))
```

# Why we are building UpTrain ü§î

Having worked with ML and NLP models for the last 8 years, we were continuosly frustated with numerous hidden failures in our models which led to us building UpTrain. UpTrain was initially started as an ML observability tool with checks to identify regression in accuracy. 

However we soon released that LLM developers face an even bigger problem -- there is no good way to measure accuracy of their LLM applications, let alone identify regression.

We also saw release of [OpenAI evals](https://github.com/openai/evals), where they proposed the use of LLMs to grade the model responses. Furthermore, we gained confidence to approach this after reading [how Anthropic leverages RLAIF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf) and dived right into the LLM evaluations research (We are soon releasing a repository of awesome evaluations research). 

So, come today, UpTrain is our attempt to bring order to LLM chaos and contribute back to the community. While a majority of developers still rely on intuition and productionise prompt changes by reviewing a couple of cases, we have heard enough regression stories to believe "evaluations and improvement" will be a key part of LLM ecosystem as the space matures.

1. Robust evaluations allows you to systematically experiment with different configurations and prevent any regressions by helping objectively select the best choice.

1. It helps you understand where your systems are going wrong, find the root cause(s) and fix them - long before your end users complain and potentially churn out.

1. Evaluations like prompt injection and jailbreak detection are essential to maintain safety and security of your LLM applications.

1. Evaluations help you provide transparency and build trust with your end-users - especially relevant if you are selling to enterprises.

<br />

# Why open-source?

1. We understand that there is **no one-size-fits-all solution** when it come to evaluations. We are increasingly seeing the desire from developers to modify the evaluation prompt or set of choices or the few shot examples, etc. We believe the best developer experience lies in open-source, instead of exposing 20 different parameters.

1. **Foster innovation**: The field of LLM evaluations and using LLM-as-a-judge is still pretty nascent. We see a lot of exciting research happening, almost on a daily basis and being open-source provides the right platform to us and our community to implement those techniques and innovate faster.

<br />
