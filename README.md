</h4>

**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source tool to evaluate LLM applications. UpTrain provides pre-built metrics to check LLM responses on aspects such as correctness, hallucination, toxicity, etc. as well as provides an easy-to-use framework to configure custom checks.

# Pre-built Evaluations We Offer üìù

| Evaluation  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Factual Accuracy](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ResponseFactualScore/) | Checks if the response is grounded by the context provided |
| [Guideline Adherence](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/GuidelineAdherenceScore/) | Checks if the response or the LLM adhers to the given guideline or not  |
| [Response Completeness](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ResponseCompleteness/) | Grades how if the response completes the given question  |
| [Response Completeness wrt Context](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ResponseCompletenessWrtContext/) | Grades how complete the response was for the question specified with respect to the information present in the context |
| [Context Relevance](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ContextRelevance/) | Evaluates if the context has all the information to answer the given question |
| [Response Relevance](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ResponseRelevance/) | Grades how relevant the generated response is or if it has any additional irrelevant information for the question asked. |
| [Tone Critique](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/ToneCritique/) | Assesses if the tone of machine-generated responses matches with the desired persona. |
| [Language Critique](https://uptrain-ai.github.io/uptrain/operators/language/LanguageCritique/) | Scores machine generated responses in a conversation. The response is evaluated on multiple aspects - fluence, politeness, grammar, and coherence. |

# Get started üôå

### Install the package through pip:
```bash
pip install uptrain
```

### How to use UpTrain:

There are two ways to use UpTrain:
1. **Open-source framework:** You can evaluate your responses via the open-source version by providing your OpenAI API key to run evaluations. UpTrain leverages a pipeline comprising GPT-3.5 calls for the same. Note that the evaluation pipeline runs on UpTrain's server but none of the data is logged.

2. **UpTrain API:** You can use UpTrain's managed service to log and evaluate your LLM responses. Just provide your UpTrain API key (no need for OpenAI keys) and UpTrain manages running evaluations for you with real-time dashboards and deep insights.

#### Open-source framework:

Follow the code snippet below to get started with UpTrain.

```python
from uptrain import EvalLLM, Evals, CritiqueTone
import json

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-***************"

data = [{
    'question': 'Which is the most popular global sport?',
    'context': "The popularity of sports can be measured in various ways, including TV viewership, social media presence, number of participants, and economic impact. Football is undoubtedly the world's most popular sport with major events like the FIFA World Cup and sports personalities like Ronaldo and Messi, drawing a followership of more than 4 billion people. Cricket is particularly popular in countries like India, Pakistan, Australia, and England. The ICC Cricket World Cup and Indian Premier League (IPL) have substantial viewership. The NBA has made basketball popular worldwide, especially in countries like the USA, Canada, China, and the Philippines. Major tennis tournaments like Wimbledon, the US Open, French Open, and Australian Open have large global audiences. Players like Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and Rafael Nadal have boosted the sport's popularity. Field Hockey is very popular in countries like India, Netherlands, and Australia. It has a considerable following in many parts of the world.",
    'response': 'Football is the most popular sport with around 4 billion followers worldwide'
}]

eval_llm = EvalLLM(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

results = eval_llm.evaluate(
    data=data,
    checks=[Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE, Evals.FACTUAL_ACCURACY, Evals.RESPONSE_RELEVANCE, CritiqueTone(persona="teacher")]
)

print(json.dumps(results, indent=3))

We recently wrote about different criteria to evaluate LLM applications and explored grouping them into categories. [Read more about it.](https://uptrain.ai/blog/how-to-evaluate-your-llm-applications)

# Why UpTrain ü§î?

Large language models are trained over billions of data points and perform really well over a wide variety of tasks. But one thing these models are not good at is being deterministic. Even with the most well-crafted prompts, the model can misbehave for certain inputs, be it hallucinations, wrong output structure, toxic or biased response, irrelevant response, and error modes can be immense. 

To ensure your LLM applications work reliably and correctly, UpTrain makes it easy for developers to evaluate the responses of their applications on multiple criteria. UpTrain's evaluation framework can be used to:

1) **Improve performance by 20%** - You can‚Äôt improve what you can‚Äôt measure. UpTrain continuously monitors your application's performance on multiple evaluation criterions and alerts you in case of any regressions with automatic root cause analysis.

1) **Iterate 3x faster** - UpTrain enables fast and robust experimentation across multiple prompts, model providers, and custom configurations, by calculating quantitative scores for direct comparison and optimal prompt selection.

1) **Mitigate LLM Hallucinations** - Hallucinations have plagued LLMs since their inception. By quantifying degree of hallucination and quality of retrieved context, UpTrain helps to detect responses with low factual accuracy and prevent them before serving to the end-users.

# What does UpTrain have to offer? üöÄ

To make it easy for you to evaluate your LLM applications, UpTrain offers:

1) **Diverse LLM Evaluations** - UpTrain provides a diverse set of pre-built metrics like response relevance, context quality, factual accuracy, language quality, etc. to evaluate your LLM applications upon.

1) **Single-line Integration** - With UpTrain's wide array of pre-built metrics, you can run LLM evaluations in less than two minutes.

1) **Customization** - UpTrain is built with customization at its core, allowing you to configure custom grading prompts and operators with just a python function.
