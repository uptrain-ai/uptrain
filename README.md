**[UpTrain](https://uptrain.ai)** is an open-source, data-secure tool for ML practitioners to observe and refine their ML models by monitoring their performance, checking for (data) distribution shifts, and collecting edge cases to retrain them upon. It integrates seamlessly with your existing production pipelines and takes minutes to get started ‚ö°.

# Get started üôå

You can quickly get started with [Google colab here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BXMMqC1Bw_LGMHtvQGJCjtQlCw6jgMxd?usp=sharing).

To run it in your machine, follow the steps below:

### Install the package through pip:
```console
pip install uptrain
```

### Run your first example:
```console
git clone git@github.com:uptrain-ai/uptrain.git
cd uptrain
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

# Why UpTrain ü§î?

Machine learning (ML) models are widely used to make critical business decisions. Still, no ML model is 100% accurate, and, further, their accuracy deteriorates over time üò£. For example, Sales prediction becomes inaccurate over time due to a shift in consumer buying habits. Additionally, due to the black boxiness nature of ML models, it's challenging to identify and fix their problems.

UpTrain solves this. We make it easy for data scientists and ML engineers to understand where their models are going wrong and help them fix them before others complain üó£Ô∏è.

UpTrain can be used for a wide variety of Machine learning models such as LLMs, recommendation models, prediction models, Computer vision models, etc.

We are constantly working to make UpTrain better. Want a new feature or need any integrations? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/issues) or [contribute](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) directly to the repository.
